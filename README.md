I started with drawing when I was a kid. Later on, as a teenager I was still busy with my lego sets. And now, I'm fascinated by the world of programming. Rarely had I have much joy and freedom in my creations with anything else other than such routines.
Actually, I'm trying to fix that.</br>
P.S: Honestly, programming is stressful and draining AF.
